# README

This directory has scripts and other files that can be used to run experiments using the new version of StationSim model.
The new version of StationSim code itself is available in the [stationsim_gcs](../..) folder, called [stationsim_gcs_model.py](../../stationsim_gcs_model.py). 


## Running Experiments

To run the experiments, use the [`run_gcs.py`](./run_gcs.py) file.

```
python run_gcs.py
```

## Analysing Results

The easiest way to analyse and visualise the results is using the iPython Jupyter Notebook: [`gcs_experiments.ipynb`](gcs_experiments.ipynb).
You will need to have [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) installed to do that.
