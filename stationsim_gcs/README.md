# README

This is an Agent-Based Simulation model of people walking in a station.
The code is [here](stationsim_gcs_model.py) and is based on [StationSim model](../stationsim/stationsim_model.py).

In this version of the StationSim model, a new collision definition is used. To implement this new collision definition, a number of methods have been changed. 
In addition, a new station structure is available. To understant these changes, see [StationSim - Grand Central Station version](StationSim_GrandCentral_version.ipynb)

## Running Experiments

To run the experiments, see [`gcs_experiments`](experiments/gcs_experiments/gcs_experiments.ipynb).
You will need to have [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) installed to do that.
